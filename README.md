Will update this soon, I believe there might be issues with now since node-webkit has moved onto io.js


A Simple Grunt configuration to quickly and automatically deploy Node-webkit based applications.

**Usage**
* ```git clone https://github.com/wookiecooking/nwfaketop.git && cd nwfaketop```
* ```npm install```
